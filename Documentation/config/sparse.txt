sparse.restrictCmds::
	Only meaningful in conjunction with core.sparseCheckout. This option
	extends sparse checkouts (which limit which paths are written to the
	worktree), so that output and operations are also limited to the
	sparsity paths where possible and implemented. The purpose of this
	option is to (1) focus output for the user on the portion of the
	repository that is of interest to them, and (2) enable potentially
	dramatic performance improvements, especially in conjunction with
	partial clones.

When this option is true (default), some git commands may limit their behavior
to the paths specified by the sparsity patterns, or to the intersection of
those paths and any (like `*.c) that the user might also specify on the command
line. For now, only git-grep honors this setting. In this command, the
restriction becomes relevant in one of these three cases: with --cached; when a
commit-ish is given; when the working tree contains [manually created] paths
that would be excluded by the sparsity patterns.
